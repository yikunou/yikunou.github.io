National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Program
------------------

* üôã Oct. 2019 - Present

* **Advisor:** Prof. Hong Wang

* **Topic:** *Imbalanced Customer Classification based on Semi-supervised Bacterial Heuristic Feature Selection.*

* **Works:**
  
  **@** Use a **semi-supervised label method** and a **synthetic minority oversampling technique** to process the customer data to increase the method‚Äôs learning effect.
  
  **@** Propose **a new structure in optimal bacterial heuristic optimization** with an alternation mechanism that controls the alternate operation of reproduction and dispersal-elimination activities, to improve the structure of the bacteria algorithm and reduce the computation cost and increase the searching diversity.
  
  **@** Design **a dynamic learning strategy** combined with a non-dominated sort strategy for bacteria running to obtain a small elite feature subset and decrease the probability of the population being trapped in a local optimal.

The Monograph Compiling
------------------
* üìï Dec. 2020 ‚Äì May 2021

* **Advisor:** Prof. Hong Wang

* **Title:** *Theory and Practice of Novel Feature Selection Algorithms*

* **Works:**

  **@** Participated in a book compiling which is led by Prof. Wang Hong. This book contains the work of our research group in the field of feature selection based on Swarm Intelligence. I was responsible for the chapters on reviews of the Swarm Intelligent feature selection methods and one of the applications in customer relationship management.

National Natural Science Foundation of China
------------------

* ‚úçÔ∏è Sept. 2019 ‚Äì Apr. 2020

* **Advisor:** Prof. Ben Niu

* **Works:**

  **@** Participated in writing for the National Natural Science Foundation of China which is led by Prof. Ben Niu. It is mainly about the Dissipative Bacterial Colony Optimization and the Multi-objective Dissipative Bacterial Colony Optimization proposed by the team.

The 'Internet+' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition
------------------

* üèÜ Sep. 2019 ‚Äì Apr. 2020

* **Core Member**

* **Advisor:** Prof. Ben Niu & Prof. Hong Wang

* **Product:** *SWARM Intelligent Medical Assistant Diagnosis Assistant*

* **Works:**

  **@** This is an innovation and entrepreneurship project which is based on swarm intelligence. We applied the technologies of bacterial optimization algorithm, image processing, and text analysis into a medical system that consists of auxiliary diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, and prognostic prediction.
